Displays ACF field instructions as tooltips using only CSS.

== Overview ==

The [Advanced Custom Fields plugin](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) by [Elliot Condon](https://www.elliotcondon.com/) is a fantastic resource for developers, allowing us to structure custom data and create a great user experience for data entry personnel.

The instruction text for ACF fields is useful, but creates visual clutter in the WordPress interface when there is a lot of instructional text. Thomas Meyer has created a great plugin to address this issue with his [ACF Tooltip Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-tooltip/). However, when using this plugin on implementations that have a large number of ACF fields, I have seen that performance drops and load-time of the WP Dashboard increases.

This plugin, ACF Simple Tooltip, is a lightweight solution that uses only two lines of JavaScript to add classes to ACF field labels which have instruction text. CSS takes care of the rest (creating the "info" â“˜ icon, styling the instruction text as a tooltip, and creating the hover functionality for showing the tooltip). Simply install the plugin, and the JS and CSS will enqueue on any post.php page in the WP Dashboard.
